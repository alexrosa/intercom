# Considerations
I had have fun developing this test. I enjoyed a lot and I hope that I achieved the goals.

# Why Python
Well, I picked Python because is simple and easy to use and manipulate vectors and lists. 
However, I spent my free time to learnig more about Python and Machine Learning. Last year I builded a small website using Django and Google Materialize. :)

# My solution
In my point of view, I used a basic solution applying a recursive approach to read a subset of arrays. I did it, because I think that is elegant and more clean. Less is more :)

# Instructions for install:
1 - I used the Pydev IDE to develop this solution. So if you want to load all the files and the entire project, I'll suggest to use the PyDev IDE. 

2 - I'll suggest you to start running the test module, which is possible to find in the package (folder): test.array_list_test.py.

3 - Feel free to run the code mainly to the main module, which is possible to find in the package (folder): solution.array_list.py. But I advise you not to do this.

4 - Have fun!
